# String-Reversal
The problem is to implement a client - server application using sockets API in C#.  
The Server application has to support at least five clients simultaneously. Server accepts strings from clients (even multiple strings from each client) and replies with reverse strings. For example, when client sends “WORLD”, Server replies with “DLROW”. Both server and client(s) have to output both sending & receiving strings on the terminal. The server and client processes should be able to run on different machines. When the client application writes “exit”, then it would terminate the client only.
